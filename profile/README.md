Link-U OS is an open-source embodied intelligent operating system designed to meet the full-scenario requirements of embodied intelligent robots. It aims to establish an ecosystem architecture that "adapts to embodied hardware on the southbound and supports intelligent applications on the northbound." At the underlying layer, it provides foundational service frameworks such as stable and efficient distributed swarm real-time communication and hardware abstraction. At the upper layer, it opens up an agent service framework that supports the standardized integration of intelligent foundation models for interaction, manipulation, and locomotion, thereby lowering the barrier to application development. Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive toolchain covering development and debugging, simulation and verification, deployment management, and data recording etc. This empowers developers to rapidly establish a technical closed loop from virtual simulation to physical deployment.
